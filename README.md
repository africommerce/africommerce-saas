## üèóÔ∏è How to Set up `Africommerce` for Development

You may want to set up the `Africommerce` repository for the following reasons:

- You want to contribute to the `Africommerce` repo in general. To contribute to this project, please check the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
- You want to use it as part of your own personal project.

### Prerequisite

In order to setup this project, you need prior knowledge on how to;
  - Use an IDE of your choice (VSCode, Sublime, Atom, etc)
  - Basic knowledge on how to use Github (fork, clone, pull, push)
  
Here is a quick overview on how to setup the `Africommerce` repository as a contributor:

- ### üç¥ Fork and Clone the Repository
  
  - First, you need to fork the `Africommerce` repository by clicking the `Fork` button on the top right corner of the repository. 
  - Next, you clone the forked repository by clicking the `code` button and then selecting the clone option.
  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Please change the directory after cloning the repository using the ` cd <folder-name> ` command. In our case, the command to be ran is  `cd africommerce-saas`


- ### Track the original repository as a remote of the forked Repository
  - To track the original repository as a remote of the forked Repository run this command;
   ```
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:africommerce/africommerce-saas.git
    git fetch upstream
   ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Please skip this step, if you are setting this project for your personal use.

- ### ‚¨áÔ∏è Install Dependencies
   Next, install the dependencies by running the following command in the folder containing the  `Africommerce` repository:
   ```bash
   npm install 
   ```
   Or
   ```bash
   yarn install 
   ```
   > **Note**: `Africommerce` runs on React 18. However, some of our dependencies are yet to upgrade to version 18. So please use the following command when you face difficulties installing the dependencies.
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```


- ### ü¶Ñ Start the Development Mode

  Use the following command to start the app in the development mode:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

  Or

  ```bash
  yarn start
  ```

  It runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

  The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- ### üß± Build the App for Production

  Use the following command to build the app for production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  Or

  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

  This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

- ### üöÄ Deploy

  You can deploy the app to `Vercel` or `Netlify` with a single click.
